## Discount Calculation Algorithm

### Base Discount Formula
```typescript
// For regular numbers (1-9)
baseDiscount = Math.min(0.25, 0.05 + (lifePathNumber * 0.01))

// For master numbers (11, 22, 33) - Exponential scaling
baseDiscount = Math.min(0.40, 0.10 + (masterNumber * 0.02) * exponentialMultiplier)
// Where exponentialMultiplier is:
// - Life Path 11: 2.5x
// - Life Path 22: 3.0x  
// - Life Path 33: 4.0x (highest)
```

### Bonus Calculations

2. **Seasonal Bonus**: 2-7% based on birth month
3. **Special Day Bonus**: 2-10% for significant dates
4. **Age Loyalty Bonus**: Up to 5% based on user age

### Total Discount Formula
```typescript
// Dynamic maximum discount based on Life Path Number
maxDiscount = lifePathNumber === 33 ? 0.75 : 
              lifePathNumber === 22 ? 0.70 :
              lifePathNumber === 11 ? 0.65 : 0.50

totalDiscount = Math.min(maxDiscount, baseDiscount + luckyBonus + seasonalBonus + specialBonus + ageBonus)
```
